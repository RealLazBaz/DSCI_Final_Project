# Predicting Perceived Importance of Mental Health
## By Jarrett Prchal and Bazin Sineshaw

### Abstract 
People have become more aware of mental health/issues over the years, as the focus on higher education and mentally intensive jobs grow. About “1 in 5 Americans will experience a mental illness in a given year” and “more than 50% will be diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder at some point in their lifetime” [1]. Do not forget the added loneliness and stress people had to face during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although mental illness affects a large proportion of people, it often goes undiagnosed or untreated because of the stigma surrounding it. 
In our research paper, we look at mental health in the growing tech industry where metal health is a growing issue. Specifically, we look to understand and predict how important mental health is perceived to be by employees through use of Open Source Mental Illnesses (OSMI) anonymous data and several different machine learning models.
